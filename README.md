## Using machine learning to speed-up Bayesian inference.

This algorithm was use sampling algorithms included in dynesty library. We implement this code within the SimpleMC cosmological parameter estimation package.

Recomended optimizer is Adam with learning rate = 1e-4.

We recomend the default architecture, but you are free to choose any other.
