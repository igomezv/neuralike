## Using machine learning to speed-up Bayesian inference.

This algorithm use sampling algorithms included in dynesty library. We implemented this code within the SimpleMC cosmological parameter estimation package.
Neural networks are programming with the pytorch framework.

Recomended optimizer is Adam with learning rate = 1e-4.

We recomend the default architecture, but you are free to choose any other.
